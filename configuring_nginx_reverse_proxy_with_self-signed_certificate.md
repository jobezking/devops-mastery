To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy with a self-signed certificate, you'll need to generate the certificate, configure Nginx to use it, and potentially adjust firewall rules. This involves creating a self-signed certificate and key using OpenSSL, then using these files in your Nginx configuration to enable SSL/TLS encryption. \[[1](https://gist.github.com/pedrouid/4abcc16c0218a46a577cfa8186cb845d), [2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04), [3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-18-04)\]

**1\. Create the Self-Signed Certificate and Key:**

* OpenSSL can be used to generate a self-signed certificate and private key.  
* Use the following command to create the key and certificate: \[[3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-18-04)\]

|     `sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt` |
| :---- |

**This will create a key file (nginx-selfsigned.key) and a certificate file (nginx-selfsigned.crt). \[[3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-18-04), [3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-18-04), [4](https://medium.com/@yakuphanbilgic3/create-self-signed-certificates-and-keys-with-openssl-4064f9165ea3#:~:text=Create%20Self%2DSigned%20Certificates%20and%20Keys%20with%20OpenSSL,country%2C%20state%2C%20locality%2C%20organization%2C%20and%20common%20name.), [5](https://docs.pritunl.com/docs/pritunl-nginx#:~:text=Nginx%20Configuration%20The%20first%20command%20below%20will,will%20write%20a%20basic%20optimized%20Nginx%20configuration.)\]**

* You'll be prompted for some information during the certificate generation, such as country, state, and organization.

**2\. Configure Nginx:**

* Edit your Nginx configuration file (usually /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or a virtual host file).  
* Add or modify a server block to handle SSL/TLS.  
* Specify the certificate and key file paths: \[[6](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1), [6](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1), [7](https://docs.rockylinux.org/fr/guides/web/nginx-mainline/#:~:text=From%20there%2C%20you%20could%20just%20start%20dropping,%E2%80%9Cnginx.%20conf%E2%80%9D%20and%20it's%20in%20/etc/nginx/%20.), [8](https://betterstack.com/community/questions/nginx-send-all-requests-to-single-html-page/), [9](https://www.docs.inductiveautomation.com/docs/8.1/tutorials/tutorials-and-helpful-tricks/defining-ssl-on-a-perspective-reverse-proxy), [10](https://bobcares.com/blog/nginx-emerg-cannot-load-certificate/#:~:text=1.%20We%20must%20make%20sure%20that%20the,ssl_certificate_key%20directives%20in%20the%20Nginx%20config%20file.)\]

|     `server {         listen 443 ssl; # Listen on port 443 for HTTPS         server_name your_domain_or_ip; # Replace with your domain or IP         ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;         ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;     }` |
| :---- |

* You may also want to configure other SSL settings, such as enabling SNI (Server Name Indication) and setting up a Diffie-Hellman group for stronger encryption. \[[1](https://gist.github.com/pedrouid/4abcc16c0218a46a577cfa8186cb845d), [6](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-20-04-1), [11](https://help.heroku.com/YTWRHLVH/how-do-i-make-my-nginx-proxy-connect-to-a-heroku-app-behind-heroku-ssl#:~:text=Heroku%20SSL%20uses%20Server%20Name%20Indication%20\(SNI\).,server%20certificate%20on%20the%20Heroku%20SSL%20endpoint.), [12](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/use-varnish-and-nginx-to-serve-wordpress-over-ssl-and-http-on-debian-8/#:~:text=You%20can%20strengthen%20the%20security%20of%20the,a%20more%20secure%20cryptographic%20key%20exchange%20process.)\]

**3\. Adjust Firewall (if needed): \[[2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04), [2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04), [13](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-on-debian-10#:~:text=How%20To%20Create%20a%20Self%2DSigned%20SSL%20Certificate,%E2%80%94%20Changing%20to%20a%20Permanent%20Redirect%20Conclusion)\]**

* If you have a firewall enabled, make sure it allows traffic on port 443 (HTTPS). \[[2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04), [14](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/quick-guide-how-to-install-a-free-ssl-certificate-on-nginx-web-server_597881#:~:text=Step%208%20%2D%20Open%20443%20Port%20in,firewall.%20Make%20sure%20you%20enabled%20443%20port.)\]

**4\. Test and Enable:**

* Test your Nginx configuration using sudo nginx \-t. \[[1](https://gist.github.com/pedrouid/4abcc16c0218a46a577cfa8186cb845d), [15](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/webapps/aspnetcore/practice-troubleshoot-linux/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy#:~:text=Before%20you%20restart%20the%20service%2C%20you%20can,that%20are%20referenced%20in%20the%20configuration%20file.), [16](https://support.boldbi.com/kb/article/1016/how-to-install-ssl-certificate-on-nginx-server-in-linux-for-bold-bi#:~:text=Save%20and%20run%20the%20sudo%20nginx%20%2Dt,verify%20the%20syntax%20of%20the%20configuration%20file.)\]  
* Restart Nginx to apply the changes using sudo systemctl restart nginx. \[[1](https://gist.github.com/pedrouid/4abcc16c0218a46a577cfa8186cb845d), [17](https://www.bigrock.in/blog/products/email/install-ssl-certificate-ubuntu-nginx#:~:text=Step%207:%20Reload%20Nginx%20to%20Apply%20Changes,the%20command%2D%20%E2%80%9Cbash%20sudo%20systemctl%20restart%20nginx.%E2%80%9D), [18](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/common-nginx-connection-errors#:~:text=Please%20note%20that%20if%20you%20made%20changes,changes%20with%20sudo%20systemctl%20restart%20nginx%20.)\]  
* Finally, visit your domain or IP address in a web browser. You should see a warning about the self-signed certificate, but the connection should be secure. \[[1](https://gist.github.com/pedrouid/4abcc16c0218a46a577cfa8186cb845d), [2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04), [19](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CJELp-aC0&pp=ygURI3Bhc2tvdnBsYW1lbnNzc2w%3D#:~:text=harden%20nginx%20reverse%20proxy%20using%20self%20signed,https%2004:12%20Generate%20self%20signed%20ssl%20certificate), [20](https://help.ivanti.com/wl/help/en_US/Studio/vnext/JavaServer/Install/GeneratingCertificate.htm#:~:text=If%20you%20create%20a%20self%2Dsigned%20certificate%2C%20web,to%20make%20an%20exception%20to%20fully%20connect.), [21](https://spaquet.medium.com/setting-up-ssl-on-localhost-for-rails-development-with-puma-211574dbfb87#:~:text=Remember%2C%20a%20self%2Dsigned%20certificate%20will%20cause%20browsers,certificate%20signed%20by%20a%20trusted%20certificate%20authority.)\]

Example Reverse Proxy Configuration:

| `server {     listen 80; # Listen on port 80 for HTTP     server_name your_domain_or_ip;     location / {         proxy_pass https://backend_server_address:443; # Forward traffic to backend HTTPS server         proxy_http_version 1.1;         proxy_set_header Host $host;         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;         proxy_ssl_verify off; # Disable SSL verification to backend     }     location / {         return 301 https://$host$request_uri; # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS     } } server {     listen 443 ssl; # Listen on port 443 for HTTPS     server_name your_domain_or_ip;     ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;     ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;     location / {         proxy_pass https://backend_server_address:443;         proxy_http_version 1.1;         proxy_set_header Host $host;         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;         proxy_ssl_verify off;     } }` |
